= Here are tips to extend the battery life as long as it can. =

 * Don't let apps run. Those are slurping your battery like soda, so use Autokill and TasKiller
 * Keep the display as low as you can have it depending on the light situation.
 * Don't use the phone if it is hot! Let it cool before use to save battery (batteries last longer when cool than when hot).
 * Use the camera sparingly! Take a picture, go home, TasKill the app quickly. The camera can deplete battery life by 20% every hour.
 * Don't use the phone right after a healthy, full charge or after turning it on. Right then it's getting syncing, apps, network, 3G, wifi, GPS, etc together, so leave it alone for about two minutes (five is best) before use.
 * Clear application cache frequently (found in the Settings/Applications/ for each app that use cache). Huge cache take longer to refresh. 
 * Disable 3G networks when you don't need them.
 * Disable auto synchronization when you don't need it.
 * Disable haptic feedback in settings and vibration for keyboard
