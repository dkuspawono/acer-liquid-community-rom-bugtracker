*1)*
Unpack the drivers.

If you have a 32-Bit version of Windows, go to the folder x86, if you have a 64-Bit version, go to the x64 folder.

Then run the setup.exe and follow the instructions.

Unpack the Acer A1 Tool.

Run the ACER Download Tool. Click "Browse" and select the downloaded ACER_LiquidE...bin.
Attach your Acer Liquid and press Start. It should start flashing the stock Éclair image.

Don't interrupt this process!!

*3)*
Unpack the Superboot.zip.

Run the Superboot-<Your OS>.bat or .sh.

This will install the root app and a custom recovery and reboot your device.

Wait until it's booted and then put our latest ROM .zip into the root of the SDCard.

Double-Click the file "Reboot to recovery.bat".

Then wait until the device is rebooted into recovery.

Navigate to "apply any .zip from SD" and push the menu key, and then choose the ROM and press menu again.

Wait for the installation to finish.

Reboot.

Congrats, you're done!
