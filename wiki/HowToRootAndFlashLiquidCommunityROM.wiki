== Factory reset / Data wipe ==

In case of crash while accessing sychronization settings, you need to do a Factory reset.

In case you wipe your data partition (factory reset) and your LCR version os prior to 1.2.3, you need to reinstall the rom update.zip file. Just apply the zip file in recovery mode.
