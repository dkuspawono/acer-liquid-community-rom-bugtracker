LCR 1.4 was *only* for Acer_LiquidE_0.010.00_EMEA_GEN1 bin file

LCR 1.3 was *only* for Acer_LiquidE_0.008.06_EMEA_GEN1 bin file

LCR 1.5 was *only* for Acer_LiquidE_0.014f.01_EMEA_GEN1 bin file.

*LCR 1.7 is based on Acer_LiquidE_1.100.39_EMEA_GEN1 bin file. We strongly advice you to update using the more recent official acer update to eclair (1.100.39). It will work on 1.100.05 bin too.

=== If you own a liquidE or already updated your liquid s100 with acer official Eclair update, you don't have to install another bin file ===

=== bin file ===

Now available on acer support page.

*Since LCR 1.4 you need to use the 0.010 bin file. If you are using the old one (Baseband A1-03.05.02 or A1-03.10.03), you have to reflash the new bin first (Baseband A1-03.12.01)* To know what baseband your are currently using ggo in Settings/About phone/Baseband.

http://code.google.com/p/acer-liquid-community-rom-bugtracker/downloads/list

== How to install ==

= Important : If you have used apps2sd before installing, always do a WIPE SD in the sdcard menu of the recovery before flashing LCR =

* Note that if you use the superboot.zip, it will install an old version of malez recovery image that may not work with your bin file. Check here http://code.google.com/p/acer-liquid-malez-recovery/ to benefit of latest enhancements *
===

=== Your current liquid android version is 1.6 (not 2.1) ===

**If you own a liquid E or a liquid s100 with the official update to Eclair from acer, you don't need to do this. You can also update using official update to Eclair (see acer support site) instead of following this step. It will be easier for you**

*1)*
Unpack the drivers.

If you have a 32-Bit version of Windows, go to the folder x86, if you have a 64-Bit version, go to the x64 folder.

Then run the setup.exe and follow the instructions.

*2)*
Unpack the Acer A1 Tool.

*important : * under windows Vista / 7 : choose Windows XP compatibility mode and "run as administrator"

Run the ACER Download Tool. Click "Browse" and select the downloaded ACER_LiquidE...bin.
Attach your Acer Liquid and press Start. It should start flashing the stock Ã‰clair image.

Don't interrupt this process!! In case of communication error during flash process. You can unplug and replug usb, don't power off the phone.


=== You already have latest bin file for android 2.1 installed (if unsure follow first step) or you have just followed the previous chapter ===

{{{
You already have installed the liquid e bin file or installed official acer 2.1 update 
If that's not the case, follow first step
}}}


*1)*
Unpack the Superboot.zip.

*2)* Check here http://code.google.com/p/acer-liquid-malez-recovery/ if a new revovery version is available. Put the new recovery in the unpacked directory and rename it recovery.img

*3)* 
Boot your phone in normal mode and check that usb debugging is enabled in settings/Apps/Developpement

*4)* Put our latest ROM .zip into the root of the SDCard. You will find our latest rom in the [http://code.google.com/p/acer-liquid-community-rom-bugtracker/downloads/list download section] of this site and is about 80 Mo.
Rom files are named LCR_XXX-signed.zip where XXX is the version number (ie 1.6 or 1.7)

To access you sd card from your computer, slide down the notification bar and choose the appropriate item.(It must be something like "Connected to an usb cable, activate to copy file")

*5)* Reboot you phone is bootloader mode using reboot-bootloader-windows.bat" (windows) or launch "sh reboot-bootloader-linux.sh, or adb reboot bootloader

*6)* Run the "install-recovery-windows.bat" (windows) or "sh install-recovery-linux.sh" (linux)

This will install a custom recovery and reboot your device.

*7)* Reboot in recovery mode.
Double-Click the file "reboot-recovery-windows.bat" (windows) or launch "sh reboot-recovery-linux.sh, or use "adb reboot recovery" (both)

Then wait until the device is rebooted into recovery.

Wait for the installation to finish.

Congrats, you're done!

== Factory reset / Data wipe ==

In case of crash while accessing sychronization settings, you need to do a Factory reset.

In case you wipe your data partition (factory reset) and your LCR version os prior to 1.2.3, you need to reinstall the rom update.zip file. Just apply the zip file in recovery mode.

== Bootloader mode ==

If one of the script just keep blocked on 'waiting for device' and you phone is connected, just control that it is booted in bootloder mode.
It a black scrren with a white moving-line on top.

Here is the button conbination to force the boot in fastboot mode.

 # Unplug the phone from usb
 # Press Volume Up + Camera button + Power button
 # The phone will vibrate twice but stay turned off
 # Take the battery out, and plug the phone into the computer again using the usb cable.
 # Phone will boot in bootloader mode

If you don't see this and the phone turns back on as normal, try it again.

 # replace the battery.
